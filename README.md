# Analysis-of-factors-influencing-annual-wage

Wages are an essential component of an individual’s life. It has the ability to impact not just the economic aspects like purchasing power and standard of living for any person but in many cases may also be a proxy for physical and mental health. Having worked as a full-time employee myself, I have witnessed the curiosity among people to better comprehend the factors that influence their monthly pay. Therefore, here, I have investigated various factors that have an effect on the annual wages of workers. Although the determination of wages is a complex phenomenon and depends on a variety of features, to name a few, market demand and supply, geographical location, bargaining power of both employers and employees etc. In this analysis my focus has been to study how a person’s age or gender, level of education and job specific features like job title, type of department, and seniority level impact wages.
